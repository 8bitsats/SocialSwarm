## Implementation Details

The agents are implemented using modern AI frameworks and SDKs:

```python
from hume import HumeClient
from game_sdk.game.chat_agent import ChatAgent
from virtuals import VirtualsClient
import asyncio

class AIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize AI capabilities
        self.hume = HumeClient(api_key=os.environ["HUME_API_KEY"])
        self.virtuals = VirtualsClient(api_key=os.environ["VIRTUALS_API_KEY"])
        self.agent = ChatAgent(
            prompt="Agent-specific prompt",
            api_key=os.environ["GAME_API_KEY"]
        )
        
        # Create persistent chat
        self.chat = self.agent.create_chat(
            partner_id="ai_swarm",
            partner_name="AI Swarm"
        )
    
    async def analyze_sentiment(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze sentiment using Hume AI"""
        config = {
            "language": {
                "sentiment": {},
                "granularity": "passage"
            }
        }
        async with self.hume.stream.connect(options={"config": config}) as socket:
            result = await socket.send_text(text)
            return result
    
    def analyze(self, state: AgentState) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Agent-specific analysis with AI enhancement
        return {
            "agent": "agent_name",

    }

    results = {}
    for name, agent in agents.items():
        results[name] = await agent.analyze(state)
    
    return results

# Run the AI swarm
asyncio.run(run_analysis())
```
